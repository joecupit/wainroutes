              <p>
                Everything on Wainroutes is provided free for all users, and I
                plan to keep it that way. However, there are costs involved in
                hosting the site, providing GPX files, and continuing to develop
                new guides and features.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you&apos;ve enjoyed using the site or found the routes useful
                and would like to support its growth and upkeep, you can donate
                using the widget below or by{" "}
                <TipLink>following this link</TipLink>. Every contribution helps
                me to continue adding routes, guides, and new resources.

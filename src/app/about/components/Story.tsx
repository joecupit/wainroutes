          <p>
            During my final year of university, I started taking regular
            day-trips to the Lake District. Before that, I&apos;d only visited
            once, but discovering the 5am train made the fells feel within
            reach. The Lakes became a place for me to relax, explore, and
            distract from my work.
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn&apos;t take long before I found out about Alfred Wainwright
            and his series of books on the Lakeland Fells, and I decided to set
            myself the challenge of climbing all 214, both to satisfy my inner
            completionist and as an excuse to see as much of the Lakes as
            possible. I&apos;d spend evenings reading about the fells and
            planning routes, and weekends introducing everyone I could to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            That idea grew into what has become Wainroutes. I wanted a place to
            bring together all the resources and information I use, and share my
            routes and photos. Now my aim is to help others discover and enjoy
            the Lakes as much as I have.
